# Good Times!

This is a little PowerShell script that helps you track your working hours by analyzing your machine's uptime.
It reads the required information from the system log and outputs it as a table.\
The script does not store any data on your computer. It only uses the data that Windows automatically provides.

## Usage

Use the batch files to get a first impression!

* Read and follow the instructions on [PowerShellâ€™s execution policy][1]

then

* Start PowerShell
* Type `.\goodTimes.ps1 <any parameters>` 

or

* Run `powershell.exe -file goodTimes.ps1 <any parameters>`
